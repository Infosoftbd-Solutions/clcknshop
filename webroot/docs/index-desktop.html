SSL certificate should be same for your primary ip and its subdomains. Eg. clckn.shop www.clckn.shop *.clckn.shop should have same SSL certificate.

The additional domain configure will be loaded from file
`/var/www/html/clcnknshop/tmp/cache/domains.apache.conf`
`/var/www/html/clcnknshop/tmp/cache/domains.nginx.conf`

this files need include only when your certificate is self signed and you are using a CDN provider like cloudflare for SSL .
If you have different ssl files for other domains then all configuration need to be done separtely for addition domains.
Also a manual restart of the webserver is needed after adding a new domain.

- **DNS Settings**

For any advance configuration instruction please email us for support instructions.
